            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language.</p>
            <p>For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
                continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World"); </code>

            <p> Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
    greetMe("World");
    </code>
            <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
                server.</p>

            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }

            <p>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
                for example:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
    greetMe("World");

            <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

            <p>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
                Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
                page about JavaScript.</p>

                <li>five</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
                user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
