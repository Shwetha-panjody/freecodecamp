                <h2>The Abilities Of Jiraiya Sensei</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chakra and Physical Prowess</strong> - Jiraiya had chakra reserves large enough to summon Gamabunta and chakra potent enough to use senjutsu.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ninjutsu</strong> - Jiraiya was a ninjutsu master,[36] famed as the "Toad Sage" (蝦蟇仙人, Gama Sennin) because of his affiliation with the toads of Mount Myōboku.</li>
                    <li><strong>Senjutsu</strong> - Jiraiya was taught how to use senjutsu by Fukasaku, which he can use to increase his speed, durability, and physical strength.[40] He can also use it to empower his other ninjutsu, such as the Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intelligence</strong> - Despite his goofy and eccentric nature, Jiraiya was actually very shrewd in the field. His specialty is intelligence gathering, having a spy network that runs throughout the Five Great Shinobi Countries that he can use to gain information about a particular person or group to be used to his or his allies' advantage.
